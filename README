AdaBoost-LIBLINEAR
==================
`Adaboost.c` is an implementation of AdaBoost with various linear models,
which are supported in LIBLINAER-1.94, as base learners.

The code is modified from `liblinear-weights-1.94`, which is available at
http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/#weights_for_data_instances
.

TODO List
=========
- improve early stopping
